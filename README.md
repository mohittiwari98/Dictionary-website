Example Sentences: Shows example sentences demonstrating how the word is used in context.
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
User-friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for a seamless experience.
Error Handling: Displays a message when the word is not found or the API call fails.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web application.
CSS: Styles and visual design to create a modern, user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for fetching word definitions, managing user inputs, and dynamically updating the UI.
Dictionary API: Fetches the word definitions and example sentences (e.g., Oxford Dictionaries API, Free Dictionary API).

How to Use:
Search for a Word: Type a word in the search bar and press the "Search" button (or hit Enter).
View Definition: The meaning(s) of the word, along with example sentences, will be displayed below the search bar.
Check for Errors: If the word is not found or there is a problem with the API call, an error message will appear.
